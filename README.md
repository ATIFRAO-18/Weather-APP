# Weather-APP
It's my first Project (Weather App). This can be done by using HTML (for the basic structure) , CSS (for designing the Layout) & JAVASCRIPT (for the behaviour of the work flow).
**Key Features:**
  A  user-friendly interface.
  User can check the Weather by enter City Name only for ease.
  It will show Live Weather Update including Temperature , WindSpeed and Humidity.
